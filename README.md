<h3>Overview</h3>
In this app, we aim to manage the essential tasks an e-store should handle. Ultimately, we will generate a list of customers along with their purchased products and the available items in the store.

Following authentication, there will be two sections. Based on the email, the app will identify whether the user is an Admin or Customer and redirect them to the appropriate space.

Administrators have the authority to perform all administrative operations, including deleting and editing customer details. Regular users do not have these privileges.

On the other hand, customers can register and select items to purchase from a list of available products.

<h3> Steps :</h3>

We initiated the process by crafting a navigation bar, facilitating seamless transitions between the primary components of our store: Home, Products (housing the inventory of available items), and New Product (dedicated to the creation of novel offerings).

Within the Products segment, a detailed presentation of products is available, offering insights into their specifications. Additionally, within this listing, there is the functionality to selectively 'Check' a product based on preferences or requirements

Employing 'JSON Server' to emulate a Backend REST API, coupled with a localized database structured as a JSON file, we are poised to establish seamless communication between this infrastructure and our Angular application

And here, we visually manipulate the 'check' attribute of a designated product. It is imperative that any alteration made reflects not only in the frontend presentation but also synchronously updates the corresponding value in the backend, ensuring coherence between both domains.

Now, employing a 'Reactive Form,' we aim to facilitate the seamless insertion of new products. Presented below is a narrative that outlines the process and the ensuing results

In this stage we implemented a search functionality enabling users to filter products based on their names
