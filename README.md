<h3>Overview</h3>
In this app, we aim to manage the essential tasks an e-store should handle. Ultimately, we will generate a list of customers along with their purchased products and the available items in the store.

Following authentication, there will be two sections. Based on the email, the app will identify whether the user is an Admin or Customer and redirect them to the appropriate space.

Administrators have the authority to perform all administrative operations, including deleting and editing customer details. Regular users do not have these privileges.

On the other hand, customers can register and select items to purchase from a list of available products.
